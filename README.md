📊 Data Integration & Management Philosophy

As a Data Integration Expert, my focus is on creating seamless pipelines that ensure data consistency across disparate systems. I specialize in building robust SQL structures and ETL workflows that prioritize ACID compliance and Data Integrity. In a cybersecurity context, I implement advanced protection against SQLi (SQL Injection) and ensure that every point of data transit is encrypted and optimized for maximum throughput.
